The posts on this site attempt to walk through both mathematical and scientific concepts in a way that
is easy for anyone to follow.

Some topics require a more mathematical background to understand the
equations, but the step by step logic is always given without any jumps or assumptions.

If you find any errors in reasoning, missing steps, or jumps in reasoning that don't make sense,
please contact me at [dg.briseno@gmail.com](mailto:dg.briseno@gmail.com) and we'll edit the posts
to fix the errors and make them easier to follow along with.
