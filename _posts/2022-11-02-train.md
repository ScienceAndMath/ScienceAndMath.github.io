This problem feels like a classic to me.

Question 4.6 from [_Exercises for the Feynman Lectures on Physics_](https://archive.org/details/exercises-for-the-feynman-lectures-on-physics-etc.-z-lib.org).

Consider a train that can accelerate with an acceleration of $$20cm\ s^{-2}$$ and slows down with a deceleration (braking speed) of $$100cm\ s^{-2}$$. Find the minimum time $$t$$ for the train to travel between two stations $$2km$$ apart.

# Solution
This is a question about kinematics. We use the following equations for position, velocity, and acceleration.

$$\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2\\
v &= v_0 + at\\
a &= constant
\end{align}$$

This is an example of motion in one dimension. Just thinking about the train, we know the train begins stopped. It has just picked up some passengers. And it is going to end stopped, so that it can drop them off. So here's what we know about the problem just from thinking about the scenario:

$$\begin{align}
x_0 &= 0\\
v_0 &= 0\\
x_{end} &= 2km = 200000cm\\
v_{end} &= 0
\end{align}$$

In summary, these equations say. $$x_0$$ at the first station is 0. It starts from being stopped so $$v_0 = 0$$ We end at the 2nd station 2km away. And we end stopped as well.

The minimum time to get to the next station means the train must accelerate as much as it can until it reaches a point where must begin to stop so that it can be completely stopped at the next station. It must accelerate for some time $$t1$$ and then brake for some time $$t2$$. The total travel time will be $$t1 + t2$$.

## Acceleration
When the train leaves the first station, it's motion follows these equations.

$$\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 = \frac{1}{2}20t^2 = 10t^2\\
v &= 20t
\end{align}$$

## Braking
When the train begins to start braking, it will be at:

$$
x_0 = 10t_1^2
$$

That is, after accelerating for some time $$t_1$$ it will have travelled $$x_0$$ cm. It will also have velocity:

$$
v_0 = 20t_1
$$

So the equations for motion of when braking are

$$\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 = 10t_1^2 + 20t_1t - \frac{1}{2}100t^2\\
x &= 10t_1^2 + 20t_1t - 50t^2
\end{align}$$

Finally, we only need one more relationship. That is, what is $$t_1$$?
Well when the train reaches the second station, it will be stopped. We know after time $$t1$$ it will have velocity $$v_0 = 20t_1$$. This gives us:

$$\begin{align}
0 &= v_0 - at = 20t_1 - 100t_2\\
100t_2 &= 20t_1\\
5t_2 &= t_1
\end{align}$$

$$t1$$ is acceleration time and $$t2$$ is stopping time. The train will be at the station after $$t1 + t2$$ seconds have passed. So this equation is saying the train must accelerate 5 times longer than braking.

Let's plug everything in and we have

$$\begin{align}
2km &= 10t_1^2 + 20t_1t_2 - 50t_2^2\\
2km &= 10(5t_2)^2 + 20(5t_2)t_2 - 50t_2^2\\
2km &= 250t_2^2 + 100t_2^2 - 50t_2^2\\
Change\ &km\ to\ cm!\\
2*10^5 &= 300t_2^2\\
666.66 &= t_2^2\\
25.82 &= t_2
\end{align}$$

The train brakes for 25.82 seconds. So using our other relation, it must accelerate for 5 times that long: 129.1 seconds. So the total travel time is 154.92 seconds.
